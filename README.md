## Overview

This map provides high-resolution spatial risk assessments for Nipah virus (NiV) transmission in Bangladesh and South India. The interactive web map allows researchers, public health officials, and decision-makers to explore risk patterns and identify high-priority areas for surveillance and intervention.

## Map Features

Nipah Virus Risk Mapping — Bangladesh & South India

This interactive web map visualizes multi-scale Nipah virus suitability and risk surfaces across Bangladesh and South India. The goal is to provide a fast, browser-based way to explore where environmental suitability and risk signals are highest, and how these patterns relate to known outbreak locations and administrative context.

Regional layer (1 km)
ENM – Regional Suitability: A continuous surface representing modeled ecological suitability for Nipah virus spillover conditions across the broader region. Higher values indicate greater suitability relative to the study domain.

High-resolution layers (100 m)
Population Risk and Landcover Risk surfaces are provided separately for:

Bangladesh
South India

These layers use a discrete risk classification scheme (e.g., No Risk → Very High Risk). You can toggle individual risk classes in the legend to isolate specific zones.

Vector overlays

Historical Nipah events (2001–2026) are shown as clickable point markers with attribute popups (year, coordinates, and reference).
A study region boundary (“M Region”) provides geographic context for model extent.
The January 2026 West Bengal district overlay includes a narrative popup with an external reference link.

How to use the map

Use the Layer Control (top-left) to switch basemaps, change raster layers, and toggle vector overlays.
Use the Legend (bottom-right) to interpret color ramps and risk classes. For discrete risk layers, you can turn classes on/off to simplify interpretation.
Adjust raster visibility using the Opacity sliders.
Use the measurement tools (top-right) to draw distance/area shapes.
Right-click anywhere on the map to copy coordinates to your clipboard.

Technical notes

Raster layers are served as Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) for efficient web loading.
Vector overlays are GeoJSON and rendered above the rasters for clear interpretation.

Disclaimer

This map is intended for visualization and research support. It does not represent real-time case reporting or a clinical/public health advisory. Interpret results within the limits of the underlying data and modeling assumptions.

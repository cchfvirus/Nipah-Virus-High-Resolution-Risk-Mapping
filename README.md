## Overview

This map provides high-resolution spatial risk assessments for Nipah virus (NiV) transmission in Bangladesh and South India. The interactive web map allows researchers, public health officials, and decision-makers to explore risk patterns and identify high-priority areas for surveillance and intervention.

## Map Features

#### 1. **Ecological Niche Model (ENM) - Median Suitability**
- **Resolution:** 1 kilometer
- **Description:** Shows environmental suitability for Nipah virus transmission based on ecological factors
- **Color Scale:** Gray (low suitability) → Dark Red (high suitability)
- **Use Cases:** Identifying potential spillover regions, long-term risk assessment

#### 2. **Weighted Risk Surface - South India and Bangladesh**
- **Resolution:** 100 meters
- **Description:** Integrated risk assessment combining multiple epidemiological and environmental factors
- **Color Scale:** Light Yellow (low risk) → Dark Red (high risk)
- **Use Cases:** Fine-scale intervention planning, local surveillance prioritization

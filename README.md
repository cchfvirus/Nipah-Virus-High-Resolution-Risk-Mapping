Nipah Virus High-Resolution Risk Mapping

Nipah virus is one of the world's deadliest emerging diseases, with 40-75% case fatality rates and pandemic potential recognized by the World Health Organization. Recent outbreaks in Kerala (2018-2025) and the ongoing 2026 West Bengal crisis have exposed critical gaps in our ability to predict where the next spillover will occur.

The Problem: Traditional disease risk maps operate at coarse scales (1-10km) and miss the landscape-level transmission pathways that actually drive outbreaks.

The Solution: This framework provides the first high-resolution (100m) Nipah virus risk assessment that integrates climate suitability, population exposure, and real transmission pathway ecology.

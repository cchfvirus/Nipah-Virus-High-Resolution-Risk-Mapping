Nipah Virus High-Resolution Risk Mapping

Nipah virus is one of the world's deadliest emerging diseases, with 40-75% case fatality rates and pandemic potential recognized by the World Health Organization. Recent outbreaks in Kerala (2018-2025) and the ongoing 2026 West Bengal crisis have exposed critical gaps in our ability to predict where the next spillover will occur.

The Problem: Traditional disease risk maps operate at coarse scales (1-10km) and miss the landscape-level transmission pathways that actually drive outbreaks.

The Solution: This framework provides the first high-resolution (100m) Nipah virus risk assessment that integrates climate suitability, population exposure, and land cover.

- **Weighted Risk Surface** (100m resolution)
- Interactive tools for measurement and data queries
- Multiple basemap options (Street, Satellite)

## Layers

### 1. Ecological Niche Model (ENM)
- Resolution: 1km
- Shows ecological suitability for Nipah virus transmission
- Color scale: Gray (low) to Dark Red (high)

### 2. Weighted Risk Surface
- Resolution: 100m
- Combined risk assessment incorporating multiple factors
- Color scale: Light Yellow (low) to Dark Red (high)
